description: |
  Nextcloud is a suite of client-server software for creating and using file hosting services.
  It is functionally similar to Dropbox, but Nextcloud is free and open-source, which means that
  anyone is allowed to install and operate it on a private server.

  This charm was originally developed by Andre Ruiz <andre.ruiz@canonical.com>.
